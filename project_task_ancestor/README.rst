For some companies, having ancestor tasks is essential for structuring
and organizing their work. However, in version 18, Odoo removed this
feature, considering it unnecessary.

This module restores the ancestor task field with its associated logic,
making it available again in Timesheets and Project reports.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to organize tasks in a hierarchical
structure, where tasks can be nested within others. The top-level parent
task in this hierarchy is the ancestor task.

In both the Project and Timesheet apps, you can Group by the ancestor
task, and this field is also available for use in Project and Timesheet
reports.
